# Numerical Analysis 

The above codes are solutions to the problems in the Numerical Analysis and Tools conducted during the Quark Summer Technical Project 2024 by Mathematics Club, IIT Madras, in collaboration with Quark BITS Goa.

Mathematics Club, IIT Madras, conducted this workshop consisting of 3 online lectures and three assignments to complete this workshop and receive a certificate. 


## File Description

Simpsons_Function is a function to calculate the value of a definite integral using Simpsons 1/3rd Rule of Integration, which takes the function, lower bound, and upper bound of the integral and no. of even divisions as input.

PDE_Method_Differences is the solution to a problem in the second assignment, asking to use the Method of Differences and Central Difference Approximation to find the displacement of points on a string whose equation at rest was provided.

Drum_Filter solves a problem in the third assignment, asking to tone down the Snare Drums by 25% using Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform in GNU Octave.
